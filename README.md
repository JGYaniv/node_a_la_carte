# node_a_la_carte
serving node module details Ã  la carte

## tech stack

The project is live on Heroku: (https://node-a-la-carte.herokuapp.com)
The private github repo link: (https://github.com/jgyaniv/node_a_la_carte)

## known issues:
* Need to figure out the webpack config settings to bundle most of the modules out there.

* Webpack is still bundling for development even though the bash script and config file specify development. Need to debug.

* There are currently no tests in place and this backend was pieced together in a day, hopefully it will work for demonstration purposes.
